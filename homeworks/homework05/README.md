If you love Computer Vision, or if the homework04 seems a bit too complex, you might stick to solving the [Image Captioning](https://github.com/yandexdataschool/Practical_DL/tree/spring20/homework04) problem in the great homework by the PracticalDL course team. It might requre basic knowledge of CV as well. 

The Image Captioning assignment has _basic_ (just LSTM) and _advanced_ (LSTM with attention/Transformer/...)  modes. The _advanced_ one requires much more disk space, so it's a good idea to start from _basic_ one.

Solving _basic_ part is enougth, although _advanced_ will give you more challenge (and points ;) )



If you want more, you might solve both homework04 and homework05. Good luck!
